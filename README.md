JsForDummies is a large library of example Macros for Minecraft, powered by the amazing [JsMacros](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jsmacros) mod from [WagYourTail](https://www.github.com/wagyourtail).

*JSForDummies2 - .js Examples for JS Macros
"JSForDummies2" - JavaScript Macro pack for "JS Macros" and "Meteor Client" 
"Out of the box" examples

Chaotic but plentiful library of super simple methods and classes, designed for dummies to get an entrance into Macro creation. 

Everything from HUDs, Vanilla Mappings, to remote control, various events, methods & classes. - Everything JavaScript dummies might need.

Un-Refined version, straight out of my folder.
More-less usage & class macro library.
